# Part 2: FastAPI Implementation for Generative AI Content Creation

This part of the project focuses on transitioning our content creation prototype into a deployable application using FastAPI. The goal is to provide a robust server-side solution for generating both text and image content through a request-response mechanism.

## Overview

In Part 2, we introduce a FastAPI server that handles content creation requests. The application uses OpenAI's GPT models for text generation and DALLÂ·E 3 for image production, enabling the dynamic creation of blog posts and corresponding illustrations. Additionally, the project supports linking the generated content to social media platforms like LinkedIn.

## API Endpoints

## POST `/basic`

- Description: Initiates the content creation workflow based on a given topic.
- Request Body:
  topic: The subject for which content needs to be generated.
  research: A boolean indicating whether research should be included in the content creation process.
- Response: Returns a message indicating the completion of the workflow.

## Installation and Setup

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generative-ai-content-assistant.git
cd generative-ai-content-assistant/part2

Create a Virtual Environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the project root with your API keys as shown below:

TAVILY_SEARCH_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

Run the FastAPI Server:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

## Workflow Explanation

1. ContentCreationWorkflow: This is the core workflow that orchestrates content generation:
2. start: Determines the workflow path based on whether additional research is requested.
3. step_research: Conducts research to gather additional content.
4. step_blog_without_research & step_blog: Generates a blog post, with or without additional research.
5. step_social_media: Formats the blog post for social media platforms like LinkedIn.
6. step_illustrator: Generates an image based on the blog content.
7. step_collection: Collects the outputs and finalizes the workflow.

## Environment Variables

Ensure that the following environment variables are set appropriately in your .env file:

- TAVILY_SEARCH_API_KEY: The API key for Tavily Search.
- OPENAI_API_KEY: The API key for accessing OpenAI services.
